hl2 mounter

dotnet build .\hl2.csproj -c Release in proj folder, then find the hl2mounts .dll and put it in sbox folder mount\hl2\ and also copy Assets\shaders\ into there from this folder
animations wip, ragdolls work though with joints etc as well as materials/textures and whatnot

TODO:

flexes/morphs once accessible via the API
animations (along with a SENT for the sandbox gamemode to play individual animations if needed)
maps/scenes once also accessible/have a valid example from an official mount
